# Mapping_Earthquakes

View interactive map [here](https://mapping-earthquakes.web.app).

## Overview
This analysis compares magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days in relation to the tectonic plates. GeoJSON data is pulled from the USGS website which is a real-time source hosting live data. The map is broken up into 3 layers - earthquakes, tectonic plates, and earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher - all of which can be viewed together or separately.
